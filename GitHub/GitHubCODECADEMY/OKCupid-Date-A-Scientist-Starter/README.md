CONCLUSIONS:

The data is highly useful for making predictions. However, to accurately predict "religion," it is essential to properly vectorize the union of words in the variables' comments to achieve accurate emotive translation for machine learning.

Our analysis reveals that 50% of the individuals are single, unemployed, and aged between 25 and 45. The average income is approximately €57,362, and the majority are men.

There are significant differences in drug consumption, with men consuming more drugs than women.

Regarding religion prediction, the accuracy across all models studied—Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—is around 25%. This indicates that while the current models provide some insight, further study of all features and proper grouping of relevant words in the ten features could potentially improve the score.

Additionally, I experimented with creating an NLP model by vectorizing the words from all features that describe the individual, similar to the approach used in the 'essay.' However, the accuracy was similar, and incorporating this model did not prove to be necessary. Instead, I focused on clarifying infinitive verbs and important words, converting them into vectors, and using them based on frequency and significance.

I hope you find this information useful.

Best regards,
Javier
