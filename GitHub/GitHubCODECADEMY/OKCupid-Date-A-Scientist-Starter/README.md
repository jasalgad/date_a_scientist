CONCLUSIONS:

The data is very usefull to make any predictions, eventhough to predict "sign", the only thing you need is to vectorized correctly the union of words on variables comments in order to make correct emotive translation for machine learning

We can see that the 50% of the people are single, doesn´t have a work and are on age between 25-45. The media income is about 2.500€.

ON the sign prediction, there is an 8% of accuarcy, but is work enough to have the knowledge that If I study all the features, and tring to agrupate the correct words on all the 9 features about them, I could find a better score; even though I get an LEO on one of the best predictions witch is my wife sign.

I hope you enyoy.
